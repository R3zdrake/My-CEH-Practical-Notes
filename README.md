1.) The trick is in the question and the type of computer where the file is located. There is a lab in CEH v10 Module 13 that mirrors it exactly. There are components of the question that give it away, follow the lab steps and it's too easy.
2.) Veracrypt is covered in CEH V10 Module 20 Lab 6 and the finding the answer is similar to the lab.
3.) Rainbow table cracking is covered in CEH V10 Module 6 Lab 2. One easy to use tool.
4.) Keep in mind what the first D in DDoS stands for. Distributed. Meaning it must be coming from multiple IPs against one single IP target. It is easy to filter Wireshark on destination IP to see if multiple people are attempting connections to a single IP.
